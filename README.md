# NawaMarga
Nawa Marga is a series of trauma-sensitive lesson plans/training sessions created by the Rato Bangala Foundation and Karkhana after the April 25th, 2015 earthquake in Nepal. The first phase of Nawa Marga (A New Path) has 5 days of lesson plans teachers can use to welcome their students back to school. The emphasis of the lessons are on making children feel safe, and give them various means (verbal, body-based, art-based) to express what they have seen and felt. These lesson plans were a collaboration between several school leaders, psychologists and teachers. They were created to share and reach as widely as available. So please feel free to use them.
